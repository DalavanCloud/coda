1.1.1 2008-10-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The required zlib files are now included in the CODA package and all zlib
  functions are 'name mangled'. This solves an issue with running the CODA
  IDL interface on Linux.

1.1.0 2008-10-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the following CODA expression operations
  - multiplication of floating point values
  - reading of floating point values

* CODA expressions now allow combining integer and floating point arguments
  in a floating point expression (e.g. compare integer against float, or add
  float to integer) without the need to explicitly cast the integer to a float.

* Added abs() function to CODA expressions

* Upgraded to expat 2.0.1

* Files with an ASCII definition are now properly marked as files with an ASCII
  format.

1.0.0 2008-09-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First official release.
