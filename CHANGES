1.2.1 2009-03-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed '|' and '&' usage in CODA expressions.

1.2.0 2009-02-20
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Python interface of CODA now uses numpy instead of numarray.

* The codadd command line tool now has a 'list' mode to inspect available
  format definitions.

* Fixed support for HDF5 datasets containing variable length strings.

* Added support for coda_format_netcdf and coda_format_cdf as official formats.
  CODA will however (still) use the HDF4 backend to read data from these files.
  Note that coda_format_netcdf only referes to pre-4.0 NetCDF formatted files.
  NetCDF 4.0 files are in HDF5 format and will thus have coda_format_hdf5.

* Fixed issue with reading of rank-0 SDS data from HDF4 and NetCDF files.

* Fixed issue where all fieldnames in HDF4 files got called 'unnamed' and where
  reading of VData data failed.

* Changed maximum cursor depth (CODA_CURSOR_MAXDEPTH) from 16 to 32.

* Added ceil(), floor(), round(), isnan(), isinf(), ismininf(), isplusinf(),
  ltrim(), rtrim(), trim(), and unboundindex() functions and bitwise
  AND '&' and OR '|' operators to CODA expressions.

* CODA expressions now accept floating point constants in FORTRAN format
  (using a 'D' for specifying the exponent: e.g. .133000D+03)

* Various improvements to reading of .codadef files.

1.1.1 2008-10-21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The required zlib files are now included in the CODA package and all zlib
  functions are 'name mangled'. This solves an issue with running the CODA
  IDL interface on Linux.

1.1.0 2008-10-10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed the following CODA expression operations
  - multiplication of floating point values
  - reading of floating point values

* CODA expressions now allow combining integer and floating point arguments
  in a floating point expression (e.g. compare integer against float, or add
  float to integer) without the need to explicitly cast the integer to a float.

* Added abs() function to CODA expressions.

* Upgraded to expat 2.0.1.

* Files with an ASCII definition are now properly marked as files with an ASCII
  format.

1.0.0 2008-09-24
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* First official release.
