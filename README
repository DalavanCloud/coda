                CODA 1.0.0 Release Notes


CODA is the Common Data Access framework that allows reading of scientific data
from various data formats, including structured ascii, structured binary, XML,
HDF4, and HDF5. It provides a single consistent hierarchical view on data
independent of the underlying storage format.

CODA is used as a core component in various ESA software among which the
Basic Envisat Atmospheric Toolbox (BEAT) and the Basic Radar Altimetry Toolbox
(BRAT).

The CODA software package comes with interfaces for C, Fortran, IDL, MATLAB,
and Python and several useful command-line tools.

In order to make use of the data acces facilities of CODA, you will need to
have the CODA product format definition files (.codadef files) for the data
products that you want to access. It is important to note that the CODA
software package does not come with any product format definition files itself!
The get access to .codadef files have a look at the software packages that make
use of CODA.

Since HDF4 and HDF5 files are selfdescribing (i.e. their format can be
determined from the file itself), you can still use CODA without any .codadef
files to access HDF4 and HDF5 data.
